## FT-GPI

As presented at the TMPred web-service (http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/TMPRED_form.html): "The TMPred (Transmembrane Predictor) makes a prediction of membrane-spanning regions and their orientation. The algorithm is based on the statistical analysis of TMbase, a database of naturally occurring transmembrane proteins. The prediction is made using a combination of several weight-matrices for scoring''. The FT-GPI project offers a C++11 updated off-line version of TMPred for fasta files. Also, our version allows to modified all the internal parameters use by TMPred to detect transmembranes. For more information of how TMPred works please refer to http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/tmbase/TMBASE_doc.html


## Requirements

In order to successfully compile FT-GPI in Ubuntu-Linux machine you need: 
- An updated g++ version compiler
- An installed updated version of the cmake build system (version â‰¥ 3.5)
- An installed updated version of the boost library
- An installed updated version of gnuplot


##Compile

To be able to compile the codes: 
- Check that the boost library is correctly pointed in the CMakeLists.txt file
- Create the build folder if it does not exists
	- mkdir build
- Access the build folder and tun
	- cmake ..
	- make

                                  		acids (or 5% if p is set)
  		-e [ --end ] arg                maximum distance between the Cterm with the

                                  		(or 1% if p is set)
  		-n [ --n-score ] arg            minimum score of the Nterm. Default: 1000
  		-c [ --c-score ] arg            minimum score of the Cterm. Default: 1800
  		-i [ --i-score ] arg            maximum score allowed for all internal 
                                  		helixes. Default: -1 (not seted)
  		-k [ --i-score-percentage ] arg maximum (excluded) allowed score for internal
                                  		helixes computed as k*max-score(Nterm, 
                                  		Cterm). Default: 1.0

		TMPred Options:
  		-m [ --min-len ] arg            minimal length of transmembrane sequence. 
                                  		Default: 17
  		-M [ --max-len ] arg            maximal length of transmembrane sequence. 
                                  		Default: 35
  		-l [ --low-osl ] arg            low orientational significance level. 
                                  		Default: 80
  		-g [ --high-osl ] arg           high orientational significance level.

                                  		Default: 80

        
This project includes an example file in the example folder. The -g option generates the scores graphs using the gnu-iostream.h code which 
is the C++ interface to gnuplot implemented by Daniel Stahlke (http://www.stahlke.org/dan/gnuplot-iostream).

			
Note: While our tool was implemented in a Linux machine, it had been successfully tested using Cygwin (https://www.cygwin.com/) in a Window machine 
(there could be problems with the gnuplot-iostream.h code, which we recommend to comment from the tmpred.h code, including any call to its methods).
